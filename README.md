# Tensorflow Deeplearning
TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. This repository is an implementation of the exercises in the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program that teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow.

## About the notebooks
In this repo, youâ€™ll find notebooks that implement necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow which you can apply to  a wide range of problems and projects. 

## For me
I am using this program/training to prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam.
